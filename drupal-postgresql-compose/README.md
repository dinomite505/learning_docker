# Building a Compose File for Drupal and PostgreSQL Project
<br>

## Assignment Info

What you need to do in this project:

    ** Build a basic compose file for a Drupal content management system website.
    ** Using drupal image along with postgres image (Drupal needs database running behind it)
    ** Use DockerHub documentation on these images to get more information
    ** Use ports inside of the compose file to expose Drupal on 8080 so you can localhost:8080
    ** Be sure to set POSTGRES_PASSWORD for postgres service
    ** Walk through Drupal setup via browser once you start with `docker compose up`
    ** Tip: Drupal assumes DB is **localhost**, but it is service name
    ** Extra Credit: Use volumes to store Drupal unique data
